# DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature

This project is an evaluation of [DetectGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11305v1), which is a zero-shot AI-generated text detection algorithm. The original paper used XSum, which is a news article summarization dataset for their experiments. Here, we evaluate DetectGPT for detecting AI-generated code. 

The main aim was to evaluate DetectGPT for detecting code generated by closed-source LLMs using open-sourced SLMs. 

All human-written code samples are taken from Project CodeNet, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 was used to generate negative samples for the corresponding problem statements.  


## Instructions 

1. Install the python dependencies: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run any of the bash scripts. 
```
./run_deepseek.sh
./run_qwen0.5B.sh
./run_qwen1.5B.sh
```
For quick runs, individual commands can be run from the bash scripts.
